This game works by taking the user's age and multiplying it to find out how many hours the user has been alive. the user is then prompted to guess how many hours the user has been alive. If the guess is within 1000 hours, the user is told "you are within 1000 hours" , and asked to guess again the same goes for if the user is within 100 or 10 hours. If the user is outside of 1000 hours the user is told that he either guessed too high or too low and is asked to guess again. If the user guesses correctly, the user is congratulated.
